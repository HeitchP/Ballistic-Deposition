# Ballistic Deposition Simulation

*This project was completed as part of the Complex Systems course during the Fall 2023 semester at Shahid Beheshti University.*

This project simulates surface growth using a ballistic deposition model, a process relevant to thin film growth and other physical phenomena. The model simulates particles being randomly dropped onto a substrate, sticking to the first particle they touch.

The simulation investigates the resulting surface morphology and measures properties like surface roughness and height distribution over time. This serves as an example of a stochastic process leading to complex fractal structures.
